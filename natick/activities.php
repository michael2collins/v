                <p>Many studio members have been touched by cancer. Team Villari's has participated in Relay For Life for the last three years. Relay For Life is an annual event held across the United States. People pledge to raise money and team members walk the track for 18 hours because cancer never sleeps. With the support of our studio families, we have raised over ten thousand dollars for the American Cancer Society. Our fundraisers include a Board Breaking Clinic, a Silent Auction and the sale of water bottles in the lobby. Money raised by RFL goes to raise awareness and fund research. </p>
