    <p>Karate Kamp is filled with a balance of creative crafts, energetic and
      engaging games as well as a learning element of karate for all skills and
      levels in a fun and safe environment.  My son had a blast and can't wait to
      go back!</p>

    <p> Allison has been going to Karate Kamp for the past 2 years and she is looking forward to her 3rd year.  She always has a blast.  She loves the karate themed games and karate weapons but also the other camp activities like the craft projects and water balloon fights!  Mark and his entire staff do a fabulous job to give the kids a wonderful experience! </p>

    <p> My daughter, who takes karate classes, looked forward to each and every day at Karate Kamp. There was a variety of great activities offered to keep her interested: team games, learning a new sword form, crafts of all kinds (making a tie-dye T-shirt was one of her favorite) and a bonus  ... she learned how to play chess form one of the campers. Now, six months later she still plays chess and wants to know if I am going to sign her up for Karate Kamp next summer. She is ready for a brand new experience. </p>

    <p> My kids can't wait to go back this summer. Not only do they love the karate lessons, but the extra activities like arts and crafts always have a fun spin on them too. Karate Kamp is always a summer highlight. </p>
