          <ul>

            <li> <span class="orange_font">&nbsp;</span>

              <p>The Instructor Training classes cover the basics of class structure, how to make class fun as well as providing an understanding of learning styles and how to teach students of different abilities. Instructors are certified on three levels: Instructor Assistant, Instructor Intern and Certified Instructor. At Villari's, earning a Black Belt does not entitle someone to teach. The Villari's Instructor Training Program teaches instructors how to teach students in an interesting and entertaining way. </p>

              <p> In addition, all of our instructors and classroom assistants receive monthly training to enhance their skills and ensure a consistent teaching environment.</p>

              <p>Our instructors are Black Belts in Shaolin Kempo Karate, and are trained to teach children. They become familiar with every child, learning their names, strengths and areas for improvement. Instruction is tailored to the needs of your child in a group setting. </p>

              <p>There are over 100 studios across the country teaching the Villari's system. Great Grand Master has several high ranking masters teaching around the country, who are always learning and teaching us the best ways to teach adults and children. </p>

          <ul>

            <li> <span class="purple_font">&nbsp;</span>

              <p>STORM stands for Special Team Of Role Models. One of the best ways to learn martial arts is to help teach martial arts. As students progress through the ranks they have options to help other students in the dojo. Advanced students may be invited to assist in classes with the guidance and mentoring of senior instructors. They work with an instructor and assist in a class by being a role model for the students. In addition to developing martial arts skills, STORM team members develop skills in public speaking, organization and responsibility. Developing into a teaching role is an important part of the Martial Arts tradition and allows students to "pay it forward"ù and pass along the things they have learned.</p>

            </li>

            <li> <span class="purple_font">Instructor Assistants (IA)</span>

              <p>Instructor	 Assistants go through training period that teaches them how to be helpful in the lobby, in the community and in the dojo. They have specific jobs to do perform during a class to be helpful to the Certified Instructor. </p>

            </li>

            <li> <span class="purple_font">Intern</span>

              <p>The intern in the class may run small sections of the class and work directly with the Certified Instructor to assist in implementing drills. </p>

            </li>

            <li> <span class="purple_font">Certified Instructor</span>

              <p>Once a Black Belt is Certified and ready to start teaching, they are placed in a classroom with an instructor mentor.  We have adult instructors or mentors present in each class.  The instructors will work with students in a positive environment that promotes learning martial arts and build favorable character traits. The Certified Instructor plans and implements a class according to the curriculum. </p>
