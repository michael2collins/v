import full db.  change db size
php.ini
upload_max_filesize=20M
post_max_size=25M

Search for entry post_max_size = 2M where you need to enter a larger number than the size of your database (15M in this case) i.e. 25M, next edit memory_limit and give a larger number than the one given to post_max_size. At last, edit the entry upload_max_filesize with a value smaller than post_max_size.

Starting from bigger values the order should go like this

    memory_limit
    post_max_size
    upload_max_filesize
